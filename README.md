# AMDE
A deep learning method for DDI pretict

The properties of the drug may be altered by the combination, which may cause unexpected drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Prediction of DDIs provides combination strategies of drugs for systematic and effective treatment. In most of deep learning-based methods for predicting DDI, encoded information about the drugs is insufficient in some extent, which limit the performances of DDIs prediction.
